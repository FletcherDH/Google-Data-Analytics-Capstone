# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone
Here I showcase my approach to solving the Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project.

As I learned throughout the course, I will use the six phases of the data analysis process to help complete this project.

About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
Business Task
Help analyze data to answer this question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Step 1: Ask
There are three questions that Cyclistic’s marketing team is looking to answer:
1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Step 2: Prepare
For this step, I collected data that has been organized in monthly .csv files from the source provided for this project (Data Source).

Sub-questions:
1.	Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? This data is from 2021 and has been collected by Cyclistic directly. It includes all rides from 2021, and therefore it is not a sample from the whole dataset. Since the data has been collected from the company directly, it is possible to assume that there are no issues around bias or credibility with this data. 
2.	How are you addressing Licensing, Privacy, Security, and Accessibility? The data is protected under this license (License). The data does not contain any personal information of the users, therefore there are no privacy concerns.

Step 3: Process

In this step, I processed the data to get it ready for the next step which is where I will look for insights in data that will help me answer the stakeholder questions. For this step, I have chosen to use R since we are working with very large datasets.

The final 3 steps, Analyze, Share, and Act, can be found on the Tableau Public Story I created for this project: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fletcher.henson/viz/GoogleDataAnalyticsCapstoneProject_16569528739880/Story1
